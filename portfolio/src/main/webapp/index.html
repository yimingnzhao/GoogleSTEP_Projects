                    I'm Nathan! I was the kid that always wanted to explore something new, like trying to make plasma
                    by microwaving a grape. Now, instead of breaking microwaves, I'm striving to create without the 
                    destructive side effects. When the time came for college, I ended up chosing to study computer 
                    engineering, where most of my accidental unwanted side effects could be fixed with a 'Ctrl+C' or 
                    a 'git revert', but where I still have the opportunity to make objects light up, process outputs
                    of ultrasonic sensors, and just interact with the physical world with the things I build (even if
                    a few LEDs or resistors are sacrificed in the process). In my spare time, I enjoy reading scary 
                    stories, pondering different philosophical schools of thought to discover more about myself, and 
                    collecting Pokemon in hopes that I one day will complete the Pokedex, even if The Pokemon Company
                    designs more and more Pokemon every few years.
